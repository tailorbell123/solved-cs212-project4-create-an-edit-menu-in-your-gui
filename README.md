<strong>Create an Edit Menu in your GUI</strong>

Add a second menu to the GUI called <em>Edit</em> which will have one menu item called <em>Search</em>. Clicking on search should prompt the user using a JOptionPane input dialog to enter a candleâ€™s price. The GUI should then display only candles at or below that price. You will need to write a second menu handler called <em>EditMenuHandler</em>.

Create a jar file called <strong>Project4.jar</strong> and submit that to Blackboard by the due date for full credit.
